                <p>Hello fellow food lovers, my name is Humayra and I am a food connoisseur! One of my favourite things in life is simply being
                able to appreciate good food made with talent and love. As a pescatarian I have always struggled finding nice restaurants with an extensive menu, suitable for all.
                I love high end dining and have visited many restaurants, both good and bad. To gain an insight of my favourite restaurants and dishes carry on reading, and if you enjoy,
                share and comment! </p>

                <p>Buddha Bar is a high end Pan Asian retaurant filled with live entertainment, great service and wonderful staff.
                As soon as we entered we were all amazed by the gorgeous interior both in and out of the restaurant.
                We were seated in the private dining area where we had drinks waiting upon arrival.
                After getting settled in we ordered starters which were divine, followed by mains which were also outstanding.
                The portions were very large and very much worth the price.
                The night was filled with laughter, with a warm and welcoming environment from start to end.
                Although Buddha Bar is quite pricey, I would definately recommend for a special evening or celebration</p>

                <p>Shaka Zulu is a steak house in Camden and it was where I spent my 18th birthday. From the moment we walked in it was like we stepped into a party.
                Shaka Zulu is very well known for the club atmosphere however the food was amazing, with a very diverse menu ranging from exotic meats such as alligator
                to the softest vegan burgers around. As it was my birthday I was treated to the birthday package which included many surprise desserts, a birthday song and
                shoutout from the DJ and much more. The whole night was just insane, in fact one of the best nights I have ever had!
                We were given a table for our whole duration so even when we were dancing and singimg our stuff was perfectly safe.
                If youre looking for a fun place to spend a birthday or even a night out I would 100% recommend Shaka Zulu.  </p>

                <p>Coco (Tower Bridge) is a well known mid to high range mediterranean restaurant, situated in the heart of London.
                I visited Coco with very high expectations as I had seen many videos and reviews, however when compared to other restaurats of the same calibre
                it was certainly a disappointment. Although the interior was beautiful, the food was not the best and this was thought by the majority of us.
                The service was not great and we were shocked by how rude some of the staff were.
                As nice as the aesthetics were, the restaurant was overpriced and the food was not enjoyable!</p>
